# FDE Bonus Projects

Use Linux as operating system to work on this task. We cannot provide support for any Windows or macOs related problems.

## Task 1

Implement the **_avg function_** and **_constructor_** in `src/JoinQuery.cpp`. 
See the corresponding header `include/JoinQuery.hpp` for documentation of this function. 
All solutions that compute correct results and achieve a time measurement better than **6.5 seconds** on the leaderboard 
will be accepted for the bonus.

The performance evaluation will run the binary compiled from `main.cpp` so that the avg query is run for multiple 
market segments on a _TPC-H dataset_ with scale factor 1. 
The overall runtime from start to end is measured.<br>
Details about the machine this will be executed on: <br>
`Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz with 4 cores, 8 hyperthreads and 32GB of memory`

You can use the test provided in `test/JoinQuery.cpp` to check if your implementation works
correctly.

When you do performance tuning, you may use and extend the benchmark suite in `bench/JoinQuery.cpp`.

## Build
A configuration file is provided to build this project with CMake. This allows you to build the project
in the terminal but also provides the option to use Jetbrains CLion or Microsoft Visual Studio and other
IDEs.

Building from Terminal:
Start in the project directory.
```
mkdir -p build/debug
cd build/debug
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
make
```

This creates the binaries `test_all`, `bench` and `main`.

## Submit
1. Change Teamname, Realname and MatrNr in `team.txt`. 
The Teamname will be displayed publicly on the leaderboard.
You can choose an arbitrary name for this, but you are also welcome to use your real name. 
The Realname and MatrNr will be used later to verify your submission for the grade bonus.
2. Implement the task.
3. Commit your changes in git and push to the gitlab repository.
4. The build system will pick up your changes and evaluate the submission. 
If all tests succeed, your binary is handed over to the performance measurement harness. 
The resulting times will be entered into the leaderboard.
5. Visit http://contest.db.in.tum.de/ to see your result.

Make sure your builds are not failing! <br/>
